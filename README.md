Destiny Reyes/June 2026/Data Science
My goals include to first aquire a degree in Data Science, then with that degree i want to go into the navy and become a Military Intelligence Officer and serve the amount of time that I need to. Then I want to secure a VA loan once I'm out and buy a home most likely in the Virginia/Pennslyvania area. After i do that i want to open up a dessert shop , I havnet thought of what type exactly maybe frozen yogurt since its the healthiest or a coffee shop make it my own. I want to eventually build a mini house/shack in Mexico on the land that my grandmother owns where i can reside when it gets too cold up here and grow my own crops and ride horses. This is somewhat of an ide f what i want to do.
